                    <span class="light_blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by
                    a

                    Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                    work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="light_blue">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help
                    users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

                    When you log in to <span class="light_blue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
                    contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".

                    In <span class="light_blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click
                    on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                    tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                    Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
                    the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

                    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                    dropping the card from one list to another.

                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
                    will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                    action is irreversible.
